sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?: First I collected the data and then put it into a word table to compare to help with the process.
I identified that Sort 1 was marginally faster for sorted data, implying it was a bubble sort (the compared in pairs sort).
As the data was already sorted no switching is required which means it had less lines of code to run in total.

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: First I collected the data and then put it into a word table to compare to help with the process.
I indentified that sort 2 was faster for random sorting which implies merge sort is likely, as it will sort
in groups and then merge the groups together, which is easier to sort random data with.

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: First I collected the data and then put it into a word table to compare to help with the process.
I indentified that sort 3 was faster for reversed sorting which implies selection sort is likely, as it will sort
by finding the lowest value (at the end) then comparing them to the first unsorted element (which is the first one)
this means the nth unsorted value will be swapped with length-nth value.
