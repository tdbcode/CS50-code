If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

An audio aura from this database could be calculated by running the query "select AVG(energy), AVG(valence), AVG(danceability) from songs;" In the article:
https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-12-01/learn-more-about-the-audio-aura-in-your-spotify-2021-wrapped-with-aura-reader-mystic-michaela/

Mystic Michaela claims that people have auras that represent a color. Spotify mention that they calculate the aura on the 'aura spectrum' by "assigning a color to each of
six mood descriptor categories (including “happy,” “calm,” and “hopeful,”) and matching them with tracks on Spotify."

In this way you could take the values from running this query "select AVG(energy), AVG(valence), AVG(danceability) from songs;" which outputs:

 AVG(energy) | AVG(valence) | AVG(danceability) |
+-------------+--------------+-------------------+
| 0.65906     | 0.484443     | 0.71646

You could then multiply by 255 and store as an integer. These could represent color values for RGB. This could translate to 168, 124, 183 which could be color code
#A87CB7

Which would translate to this shade of purple:

This could arguably be used to explain the user's aura.

Hypothesize about why the way you’ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
