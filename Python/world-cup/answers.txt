Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: I expected that the smaller number of simulations would be faster - this is mostly true
except for when we get below 100 simulations, the timings are practically the same.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: It seems like predictions stablise after 1000 simulations as all teams appear. Anything below 1000
could be deemed inaccurate as many of the teams don't make the simulated results. It seems like results stablise 10000+ however in terms of percentage being similar.
