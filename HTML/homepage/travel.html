       <h3>Travels</h3>
       <p>Over the past 15 years I have been lucky enough to be able to travel quite extensively.</p>
       <p>I love travelling as it has helped to broaden my horizons, help me understand different people's cultures, get to taste different world cuisines and make me
         feel like a better and more well rounded person.</p>

         <p>As of April 2023 I have lived in 4 countries over my time:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>UK - My home country</li>
            <li>Italy - for 3 years in Roma!</li>
            <li>Australia - for 1 year as a gap year</li>
            <li>The United States - my current home! (Of which I have visited 49 states to date - only Hawaii to go!)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>I have also visited:</p>
          <ul>
            <li></li>
            <li>Italy - for 3 years in Roma!</li>
            <li>Australia - for 1 year as a gap year</li>
            <li>The United States - my current home!</li>
          </ul>
